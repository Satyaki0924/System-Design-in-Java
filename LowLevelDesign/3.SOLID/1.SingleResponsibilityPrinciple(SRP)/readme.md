# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Example

This section demonstrates the Single Responsibility Principle using Java classes.

## Principle

A class should have only one job or responsibility, and there should be only one reason to change that class.

## Example Structure

- `UserSRP.java`: Handles only user data (name and age).
- `DatabaseAccessSRP.java`: Handles only database save operations.
- `NotificationServiceSRP.java`: Handles only user notification logic.

Each class is designed with a distinct purpose, illustrating SRP in action.

Refer to the code files for implementation details.
